"""Regression to the mean"""
"""the more samples we take the more likely we'll be closer to the mean"""


"""Quantitying variation in data"""

"""Standard deviation need to compare with sampling data to see whether if it's accurate or not, if samples only 1000, it's accurate, but when 1 million, it is small"""

"""Applying Empirical Rule Algorithm inside roulette game"""
"""we use empirical rule to decide how much faith we should have in that value"""
"""Empirical Rule needs assumption: 
1. the mean estimation error is 0(likely to guess high and low, not bias to one direction)
2. The distribution is normal."""
